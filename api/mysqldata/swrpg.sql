INSERT INTO `race` VALUES (1,1,'PC','Abinyshi','Speak','The Abinyshi are a short, relatively slender, yellow-green reptilian species from Inysh. They possess two dark, pupil-less eyes that are set close together. Their face has few features aside from a slight horizontal slit of a mouth: their nose and ears, while extant, are very minute and barely noticeable. The species has a large, two forked tail that assists in balance and is used as an appendage and weapon.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nA gentle people, the Abinyshi take a rather passive view of life. They prefer to let events flow around them rather than take an active role in changing their circumstances. This philosophy has had disasterous consequences for Inysh.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe Abinyshi have played a minor but constant role in galactic history for many centuries. They developed space travel at about the same time as the humans, and though their techniques and technology never compared to that of the Corellians or Duros, they have long enjoyed the technology provided by their allies. Their small population limited their ability to colonize any territories outside their home system.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nTheir primary contributions have included culinary and academic developments; several fine restaurants serve Abinyshi cuisine and Abinyshi literature is still devoured by university students throughout the galaxy. The popularity of Abinyshi culture has waned greatly over the past few decades as the Abinyshi traveling the stars slowed to a trickle. Most people believe the Abinyshi destroyed themselves in a cataclysmic civil war.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn truth, the Empire nearly decimated Inysh and its people. Scouts and Mining Guild officials discovered that Inysh had massive kalonterium reserves (kalonterium is a low-grade ore used in the development of weapons and some starship construction). The Imperial mining efforts that followed all but destroyed the Inysh ecology, and devastated the indigenous flora and fauna.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nMining production slacked off considerably as alternative high-grade ored - like doonium and meleenium - became available in other systems. Eventually, the Imperial mining installations packed up and left the Abinyshi to suffer in their ruined world.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nYears ago, Abinyshi traders and merchants were a relatively common sight in regional space lanes. Abinyshi now seldom leave their world; continued persecution by the Empire has prompted them to become rather reclusive. Those who do travel tend to stick to regions with relatively light Imperial presence (such as the Corporate Sector or the Periphery) and very rarely discuss anything pertaining to their origin. Individuals who come across an Abinyshi most often take the being to be just another reptilian alien.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSurprisingly, the Abinyshi have little to say, good or bad, about the Empire, though the Empire has given them plenty of reasons to oppose it. Millennia ago, their culture learned to live with all that the universe presented, and to simply let much of the galaxy\'s trivial concerns pass them by.<br/><br/>','<br/><br/><i>Prehensile Tail</i>:   Abinyshi can use their tails as a third arm at -1D their die code. In combat, the tail does Strength damage. <br/><br/>','<br/><br/><i>Believed Extinct</i>:   Nearly all beings in the galaxy believe the Abinyshi to be extinct. <br/><br/>',12,0,10,12,0,0,0,0,1.20,1.60),(2,2,'PC','Abyssin','Speak','Very few Abyssin leave their homeworld. Those who are encountered in other parts of the galaxy are most likely slaves or former slaves who are involved in performing menial physical tasks. Some find employment as mercenaries or pit fighters, and a few of the more learned Abyssin might even work as bodyguards (though this often does not fit their temperaments).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAbyssin entry into mainstream of galactic society has not been without incident. The Abyssin proclivity for violence has resulted in numerous misunderstandings (many of these ending in death). \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAs a cautionary note, it should be added that the surest way to provoke an Abyssin into a personal Blooding is to call him a monoc (a short form of the insulting term \"monocular\" often applied to Abyssin by binocular creatures having little social consciousness or grace). \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAbyssin prefer to gather with other members of their species when they are away from Byss, primarily because they understand that only when they are among other beings with regenerative capabilities can they express their instinctive aggressive tendencies.<br/><br/>','<br/><br/><i>Regeneration</i>:   Abyssin have this special ability at 2D. They may spend beginning skill dice to improve this ability as if it were a normal skill. Abyssin roll to regenerate after being wounded using these skill dice instead of their Strength attribute - but turn \"days\" into \"hours.\" So, an Abyssin who has been wounded rolls after three standard hours instead of three standard days to see if he or she heals. In addition, the character\'s condition cannot worsen (and mortally wounded characters cannot die by rolling low). \r\n<br/><br/><i>(S) Survivial (Desert)</i>:   During character creation, Abyssin receive 2D for every 1D placed in this skill specialization, and until the skill level reaches 6D, advancement is half the normal Character Point cost. <br/><br/>','<br/><br/><i>Violent Culture</i>:   The Abyssin are a primitive people much like the Tuskin Raiders: violent and difficult for others to understand. Abyssin approach physical violence with a childlike glee and are always eager to fight. However, they are slightly less happy to be involved in a blaster fight and are of the opinion that starship combat is incredibly foolish, since you cannot regenerate once you have been explosively decompressed (this attitude has because generalized into a dislike of any type of space travel). It should be noted that the Abyssin do not think of themselves as violent or vicious. Even during a ferocious Blooding, most of those involved will be injured, not killed - their regenerative factor means that they can resort to violence first and worry about consequences later. Characters who taunt them about their appearance will find this out. <br/><br/>',12,0,8,12,0,0,0,0,1.70,2.10),(3,3,'PC','Adarians','Speak','Due to its wealth of both nautral resources and technology, the planet Adari is coveted by the Empire. However, the Adarians have been able to maintain their \"neutrality.\" Adari has the distinction of being one of the few planets to have signed a non-aggression treaty with the Empire. In return for this treaty, the Adarians supply the Empire with vast quantities of raw material for its military starship construction program - so in essence, the world is under the heel of the Empire no matter how vocally the Adarians may dispute this matter.<br/><br/>','<br/><br/><i>Search</i>:   When conducting a search that relies upon sound to locate an object or person, an Adarian receives a +2D bonus, due to his or her extended range of hearing. Adarians can hear in the ultrasonic and subsonic ranges, so thus will be able to hear machinery or people at extremely long distances (up to several kilometers away). \r\n<br/><br/><i>Languages</i>:   When speaking languages that require precise pronounciation (Basic, for example), an Adarian suffers a -1D penalty to this skill. When speaking languages that rely more upon tonal variation (Wookiee, for example), the Adarian suffers no penalty. \r\n<br/><br/><i>Adarian Long Call</i>:   Time to use: Two rounds. By puffing up the throat pouch (which takes one round), an Adarian can emit the subsonic vocalization known as the long call. This ultra-low-frequency emission of sound waves has a debilitaing effect on a number of species (particulary humans), causing disorientation, stomach upset, and possible unconsciousness. Any character standing within five meters of an Adarian who emits a long call suffers 3D stun damage. Strengthmay be used to resist this damage, but plugging the ears does not help, since it is the vibration of the brain and internal organs that does the damage. The long call may only be used safely three times per standard day; on the fourth and successive uses of the long call in any 24-hour period, an Adarian suffers stun damage himself or herself (but can use Strengthto resist this damage). The long call has no debilitating effects on other Adarians. It can however, be heard by them up to a distance of 20 kilometers in quiet, outdoor settings. \r\n\r\n<br/><br/><i>(A) Carbon-Ice Drive Programming / Repair</i>:   Time to use: Several minutes to several days. This advanced skill is used to program and repair the unique starship interfaces for the Carbon-Ice-Drive, a form of macro-scale computer. The character must have a computer programming/ repairskill of at least 5D before taking Carbon-Ice Drive programming/ repair, which costs 5 Character Points to purchase at 1D. Advancing the skill costs double the normal Character Point cost; for example, going from 1D to 1D+1 costs 2 Character Points. \r\n<br/><br/><i>(A) Carbon-Ice Drive Engineering</i>:   Time to use: Several days to several months. This is the advanced skill necessary to engineer and design Carbon-Ice Drive computers. The character must have a Carbon-Ice Drive programming/ repairskill of at least 5D before purchasing this skill, which costs 10 Character Points to purchase at 1D. Advancing the skill costs three times the normal Character Point cost. Designing a new type of Carbon-Ice Drive can take teams of engineers several years of work. \r\n<br/><br/>','<br/><br/><i>Caste System</i>:   Adarians are bound by a rigid sceel\'saracaste system and must obey the dictates of all Adarians in higher castes. Likewise, their society is run by a planetary corporation, so all Adarians must obey the requests of this corporation, often to the detriment of their own desires and objectives. <br/><br/>',12,0,10,12,0,0,0,0,1.50,2.00),(4,4,'PC','Adnerem','Speak','Adnerem are a tall, slender, dark-gray species dominant on the planet Adner. The Adnerem\'s head is triangular with a wide brain pan and narrowing face. At the top of the head is a fleshy-looking lump, which may apear to humans to be a tumor. It is, in fact, a firm, hollow, echo chamber which functions as an ear. Adnerem are bald, except for a vestigial strip of hair at the lower back of the head. Female Adnerem often grow this small patch of hair long and decorate their braids with jewelry.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe Adnerem hand is four-digited and highly flexible, but lacks a true opposable thumb. Adnerem can grow exceptionally long and sturdy nails, and the wealthy and influential often grow their nails to extraordinary lengths as a sign of their idleness. Their eyelids are narrow to protect against the overall brightness of Adner\'s twin suns and the eyes are lightly colored, usually blue or green.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAdnerem are decended from a scavenger/ hunter precursor species. Their distant ancestors were semisocial and banded together in tribepacks of five to 20. This has carried on to Adnerem today, influencing their modern temperament and culture. They remain omnivorous and opportunistic.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOutwardy calm and dispassionate, inwardly intense, the Adnerem are deeply devoted to systematic pragmatism. Each Adnerem increases his position in life by improving his steris(Adner\'s primary socio-economic family unit; plural steri). While some individual Adnerem work hard to increase the influence and wealth of their steris, most do so out of self-interest.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe Adnerem have no social classes and judge people for the power of their steris and the position they have earned in it, not for accidents of birth. Having no cultural concept of rank, they have difficulty dealing with aliens who consider social position to be an important consideration.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAdnerem are fairly asocial and introverted, and spend a great deal of their private time alone. Social gatherings are very small, usually in groups of less than five. Adnerem in a group of more than 10 members are almost always silent (public places are very quiet), but two interacting Adnerem can be as active as 10 aliens, leading to the phrase \"Two Adnerem are a party, four a dinner and six a funeral.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSometimes a pair of Adnerem form a close friendship, a non-sexual bonding called sterika. The two partners become very close and come to regard their pairing as an entity. There is no rational explanation for this behavior; it seems to be a spontaneous event that usually follows a period of individual or communal stress. Only about 10 percent of Adnerem are sterika, Adnerem do not usuallly form especially strong emotional attachments to individuals.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAdnerem steri occasionally engage in low-level raid-wars, usually when the goals of powerful steri clash or a coalition of lesser steri rise to challenge a dominant steris. A raid-war does not aim to annihilate the enemy (who may become a useful ally or tool in the future), it seeks simply to adjust the dynamic balance between steri. Most raid-wars are fast and conducted on a small scale.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFor the most part, the Adnerem are a stay-at-home species, preferring to excel and compete amongst themselves. Offworld, they almost always travel with other steris members. Some steri have taken up interstellal trading and run either large cargo ships or fleets of smaller cargo ships. A few steri have hired themselves out to corporations as management teams on small- to medium-sized projects.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe Adnerem do not trust the whims of the galactic economy and invest in maintaining their planetary self-sufficiency rather than making their economy dependent on foreign investment and imports. They have funded this course by investing and entertainment industries, both on-planet and off. Hundreds of thousands of tourists and thrill-seekers flock to the casinos, theme parks and pleasure houses of Adner, which, after 2,000 years of practice, are very adept at thrilling and pampering the crowds. These entertainment facilities are run by large steri with Adnerem management and alien employees.<br/><br/>','','<br/><br/><i>Behind the Scenes</i>:   Adnerem like to manage affairs behind the scenes, and are seldom encountered as \"front office personnel.\" <br/><br/>\r\n',12,0,10,11,0,0,0,0,1.80,2.20),(5,5,'PC','Advozsec','Speak','Many Advozsec have found opportunities inside Imperial and corporate bureaucracies across the galaxy.

Each of the outlying 28 Chiss colonies is represented with one appointed governor, or House leaders. There are four main ruling families: The Cspala, the Nuruodo, the Inrokini and the Sabosen. These families represent bloodlines that even predate modern Chiss civilisation. Every Chiss claims affiliation to one of the four families, as determined by tradition and birthplace. But in truth, the family names are only cultural holdovers. In fact the Chiss bloodlines have been mixed so much in the past, that every Chiss could claim affiliation to each of the families, and because there are no rivalries between the families, a certain affiliation wouldn\'t affect day-to-day living. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThough the Cabinet handles much of the intricacies of Chiss government, all decisions are approved by one of the four families. Every family has a special section to supervise.\r\n<br/><br/>The Csala handle colonial affairs, such as resource distribution and agriculture. The Nuruodo handle military and all foreign affairs (Grand Admiral Thrawn was a member of this family). The Inrokini handle industry, science and communication. Sabosen are responsible for justice, health and education.<br/><br/> \r\nThe Chiss government functions to siphon important decisions up the command chain to the families. Individual colonies voice their issues in the Parliament, where they are taken up by departments in the Cabinet. Then they are finally distilled to the families. The parliament positions are democratically determined by colonial vote. Cabinet positions are appointed by the most relevant families. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe Csalaï¿½s most pressing responsibility is the distribution of resources to the colonies and the people of Csilla. This is important  because the Chiss have no finances. Everything is provided by the state. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe Chiss military is a sizeable force. The Nuruodo family is ultimately in charge of the fleet and the army. Because it has been never required to act as a single unit, it was split up into 28 colonial forces, called Phalanxes. The Phalanx operations are usually guided by an officer, who is appointed by the House Leader, called a Syndic.  The Chiss keep a Expansionary Defence Fleet separate from the Phalanxes, which  serves under the foreign affairs. This CEDF patrols the boarders of Chiss space, while the Phalanxes handle everything that slips past the Fleet. In times of Crisis, like the Ssi-ruuvi threat, or the more recent Yuuzhan Vong invasion, the CEDF draws upon the nearby Phalanxes to strengthen itself, and tightening boarder patrols.<br/><br/> Though Fleet units seldom leave Chiss space, some forces had been seen fighting Vong, assisting the NR and IR Forces, like the famous 181st Tie Spike Fighter Squadron, under command of Jagged Fel.

They are known for their combination of warlike attitudes and high regard for art and culture. Physically, they are quite close to genetic baseline humans, suggesting that they evolved from a forgotten colonization effot many millennia ago. They have lithe builds with powerful musculature. Through training, the Epicanthix prepare their bodies for war, yet tone them for beauty. They are generally human in appearance, although they tend to be willowy and graceful. Their faces are somewhat longer than usual, with narrow eyes. Their long black hair is often tied in ceremonial styles which are not only attractive but practical. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nEpicanthix have always been warlike. From their civilization\'s earliest days, great armies of Epicanthix warriors marched from their mountain clan-fortresses to battle other clans for control of territory - fertile mountain pastures, high-altitude lakes, caves rich with nutritious fungus - and in quest of slaves, plunder and glory. They settled much of their large planet, and carved new knigdoms with blades and blood. During their dark ages, a warrior-chief named Canthar united many Epicanthix clans, subdued the others and declared world-wide peace. Although border disputes erupted from time to time, the cessation of hostilities was generally maintained. Peace brought a new age to Epicanthix civilization, spurring on greater developments in harvesting, architecture, commerce, and culture. While warriors continued to train and a high value was still placed on an individual\'s combat readiness, new emphasis was placed on art, scholarship, literature, and music. Idle minds must find something else to occupy them, and the Epicanthix further developed their culture. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOver time, cultural advancement heralded technological advancement, and the Epicanthix swiftly rose from an industrial society to and information and space-age level. All this time, they maintained the importance of martial training and artistic development. When they finally developed working hyperdrive starships, the Epicanthix set out to conquer their neighbors in the Pacanth Reach - their local star cluster. These first vessels were beautiful yet deadly ships of war - those civilizations which did not fall prostrate at the arrival of Epicanthix landing parties were blasted into submission. The epicanthix quickly conquered or annexed Bunduki, Ravaath, Fornow, and Sorimow, dominating all the major systems and their colonies in the Pacanth Reach. In addition to swallowing up the wealth of these conquered worlds, the Epicanthix also absorbed their cultures, immersing themselves in the art, literature and music of their subject peoples<br/><br/>\r\nImperial scouts reached Epicanthix - on the edge of the Unknown Regions - shortly after Palpatine came to power and declared his New Order. The Epicanthix were quick to size up their opponents and - realizing that battling Palpatine\'s forces was a losing proposition - quickly submitted to Imperial rule. An Imperial governor was installed to administer the Pacanth Reach, and worked with the Epicanthix to export valuable commodities (mostly minerals) and import items useful to the inhabitants. The Epicanthix still retain a certain degree of autonomy, reigning in conjunction with the Imperial governor and a handful of Imperial Army troops. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nQuite a few Epicanthix left Panatha after first contact with the Empire, although many returned after being overwhelmed by the vast diversity and unfathomable sights of the Empire\'s worlds. Some Epicanthix still venture out into the greater galaxy today, but most eventually return home after making their fortune.

Etti often have aquiline features, giving them a haughty look of superiority.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>The Etti culture has been an isolationist culture for a long time. Over 20,000 years ago, the ancestors of the modern Etti united in their opposition to the political and military policies of the Galactic Republic.

Declaring the Republic to be \"tyrannical and to oppressive,\" they left the Core Worlds and followed several scouts to a new world far removed from the reach of Coruscant.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>This new world, Etti, was mild and comfortable. Advancing terraforming and bioengineering technologies (stolen or purchased from the Republic) allowed them to develop a civilization based on aesthetic pleasures and high culture. The Etti shunned contact with the outside galaxy and their culture stagnated and became decadent.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Eventually, the rest of the galaxy \"caught up\" with the isolationist people; the newly founded Corporate Sector Authority offered the Etti control of an entire system if they would only develop and maintain it on behalf of the CSA (and, of course, share the profits). The Authority asked the Etti to terraform portions of one of the planets in the system to serve as lush estates for the Authority\'s ruling executives and to develop elaborate entertainment complexes to cater to the needs of the wealthy visitors. The Etti leaders, sensing the opportunity for great profit, accepted the offer and relocated, bringing most of the Etti population with them.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>The Etti were given relatively free reign to govern the planet (within Corporate Sector directives). They terraformed the land, making virtually every hectare burst with rich foliage.

As such, the Gand need not make stamina rolls with the same frequency as most characters for purposes of determining the effects of sleep deprivation. Unless otherwise stated, this is an assumed trait in a Gand.\r\n<br/><br/><i>Regeneration: </i> Most Gands - particularly those who have remained on their homeworld or are one of the very traditional sects - can regenerate lost limbs (fingers, arms, legs, and feet). Once a day, a Gand must make a Strength or stamina roll: Very Difficult roll results in 20 precent regeneration; a Difficult will result in 15 percent regeneration; a Moderate will result in 10 percent regeneration. Any roll below Moderate will not assist a Gand\'s accerated healing process, and the character must wait until the next day to roll.\r\n<br/><br/><i>Findsman Ceremonies:</i>	Gands use elaborate and arcane rituals to find prey.

The first layer is composed of a transparent keratin-like substance: the Gand suffers no adverse effects from sandstorms or conditions with other airborne debris. The Gands\' second layer of eye protection is an exceptionally durable chitin that can endure substantial punishment. For calculating damage, this outer layer has the sameStrength as the character.\r\n<br/><br/><i>Exoskeleton: </i> The ceremonial chemical baths of some findsmen initiations promote the growth of pronounced knobby bits on a Gand\'s exoskeleton. the bits on a Gand\'s arms or legs can be used as rough, serrated weapons in close-quarter combat and will do Strength +1 damage when brawling.\r\n<br/><br/><i>Ammonia Breathers:</i> Most Gands do not respire.

The most intelligent are the Gazaran - short bipedal creatures with several layers of scales. They have very thin membranes extending from their ribs, feet and hands, which they use to glide among the trees. Specialized muscles line the ribs so that they can control the shape and angle of portions of the membranes, giving them the ability to perform delicate maneuvers around trees and other obstacles. Their bodies are gray or brown in color, and each limb is lined with a crest of cartilage. Sharp claws give them excellent climbing abilities.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Veron is a popular tourist site in the Mektrun Cluster, with an economy driven by the whims of wealthy visitors. Gazar cities welcome tourists with open arms, and each visitor is made to feel as if he has become a personal friend of every native he meets. Despite a firm military presence, the Empire has allowed the Gazaran to retain their traditional lifestyle and government - to keep them happy and eager to please the world\'s important resort clientele.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>The tropical rain forests of Veron are known for the fevvenor trees, which cover over three-quarters of the planet\'s land mass (only the mountains and shore areas don\'t support the trees). Reaching a height of nearly 50 meters, the trees are merely the crowning feature of a complex biosphere that supports many unusual life forms. The Gazaran require higher temperatures than most other creatures on the planet and live comfortably in elevated cities built in the upper canopy.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>With the arrival of space travelers, the creatures learned all they could about other societies, taking particular interest in the \"extremely large family groups\" that tended to form with advances in technology. Since the Gazaran desperately wanted to join the galactic society, they decided to model themselves around more advanced cultures and call their home territories \"cities.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>They have learned some aspects of industry and have mastered the use of steam engines, powered primarily by wood, wind or rain. They are developing small-scale manufacturing, such as mass-produced crafts for tourists (primitive glow rods, fire-staring kits, climbing gear, short-range distress beacons, and clothing). They also use portable steam engines to assist in engineering projects. There are traces of a more advanced culture in some of the oldest cities, and some theorize that the Gazaran once had a much higher level of technology.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>The Gazaran culture doesn\'t even acknowledge the existence of the world below their treetop cities. They see the area below their homes as an impenetrable dark mist waiting to bring them to an early death. The Gazaran have built up an elaborate and extensive collection of folk tales detailing the horrible monsters that lurk below.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>While the Gazaran themselves have no interest in visiting the \"dark land,\" they know that tourists love a mystery. Exploring the ground level of the world has become a major part of the tourist trade, and as always, the Gazaran have readily adapted: many young Gazar earn their living telling tales of what is below to eager tourists.\r\n<br/><br/>','<br/><br/><i>Temperature Sensitivity:</i> Gazaran are very sensitive to temperature.

This is due in part to Geelan curiosity (trying to do something just to see if it can be done), and partly to good business (trying to do something to make money).\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Needan lies beyond the Outer Rim. Once a beautiful, jungle world, Needan was covered with innumerable species of plants and animals, with two-thirds of its surface covered by massive, life-teeming oceans. In this environment, the Geelan evolved from canine pack animals.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>After developing sentience, the Geelan followed their inherent pack instinct, and cities were soon formed. The Geelan had no predators of their own and continued to thrive as their civilization and technology soared toward unknown boundaries.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Just as the Geelan were entering the information age, their world was hit by a passing comet. Needan was wrenched from its orbit by the impact, rapidly drifting away from its life-giving sun. Most of the native species died off from the resulting cold, but the intelligent Geelan used their technology to survive by building dome-like habitats and shielding themselves from the eternal winter outside. The supply of fuels on which the Geelan relied was dwindling rapidly, however, and the species realized it did not have long to survive.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Geelan scientists immediately began broadcasting distress signals in hopes that someone would respond. Luckily for the Geelan, the signals were intercepted by an Arcona medical vessel. The vessel\'s crew followed the signals and eventually tracked them to Needan.

Their society encourages its young to take up technical professions, fearful of what might happen if they cease to be useful to their Imperial masters.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>They are an aggressive and territorial species that would make a valuable asset to the Alliance if they could be freed from Imperial rule. Unfortunately, since Yaga Minor is so heavily defended, the rescue of the Yagai is a short-term impossibility.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Yagai Drones are huge, muscular versions of the Yagai main species.

Six of these worlds have developed sentient species. Only one has reached it space age: the Yevethans of the N\'zoth system.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Yevethans are a dutiful, attentive, cautious, fatalistic species shaped by a strictly hierarchical culture. Most male Yevethans live day-to-day with the knowledge that a superior may, if moved by the need or offense, kill them. This tends to make them eager to please their betters and prove themselves more valuable alive than dead, while at the same time highly attentive to the failings of inferiors. Being sacrificed to nourish the unborn birthcasks of a much higher Yevethan is considered an honor, however.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>The Yevethan species is young compared to others in the galaxy, having only achieved sentience about 50,000 years ago. They progressed rapidly technologically, but their culture is still adolescent. Yevethan culture is unusual in that even the greatest Yevethan thinkers never seriously considered the idea that there could be other intelligent species in the universe. Intelligent and ambitious, the Yevethans began to expand out into space shortly after the development of a world-wide hierarchical governing system. Although lacking hyperdrive technology, the Yevethans settled 11 worlds using their long-range realspace thrustships. None of these worlds were occupied by the few sentients of the Cluster, and until contact between the Empire and Yevethans, Yevethan culture saw its own intelligence as a unique feature of existence. The Yevethans are highly xenophobic and consider other intelligent life morally inferior.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>The contact between the Empire and Yevethan Protectorate led swiftly to Imperial occupation. The species was discovered to possess considerable technical aptitude and a number of Black Sword Command shipyards were established in Yevethan systems using conscripted Yevethan labor. Despite early incidents of sabotage, the shipyards have acquired a reputation for excellence, and with Yevethan acceptance of the New Order, have been one of the most efficient conscript facilities of the Empire.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>At the time of initial contact the Yevethans were in a late information age, just on the cusp of a space age level of technology. The Yevethans have established no trade with alien worlds and exhibit no interest in external trade.

The inhabitants of the Uba system led a peaceful existence, cultivating their lush planet and creating a complex and highly sophisticated culture. When off-world traders discovered Uba and brought new technology to the planet, they awakened an interest within the Ubese that grew into an obsession. The Ubese hoarded whatever technology they could get their hands on - from repulsorlift vehicles and droids to blasters and starships. They traded what they could to acquire more technology. Initially, Ubese society benefited - productivity rose in all aspects of business, health conditions improved so much that a population boom forced the colonization of several other worlds in their system.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Ubese society soon paid the price for such rapid technological improvements: their culture began to collapse. Technology broke clan boundaries, bringing everyone closer, disseminating information more quickly and accurately, and allowing certain ambitious individuals to influence public and political opinion on entire continents with ease.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Within a few decades, the influx of new technology had sparked the Ubese\'s interest in creating technology of their own. The Ubese leaders looked out at the other systems nearby and where once they might have seen exciting new cultures and opportunities for trade and cultural exchange, they now saw civilizations waiting to be conquered. Acquiring more technology would let the Ubese to spread their power and influence.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>When the local sector observers discovered the Ubese were manufacturing weapons which had been banned since the formation of the Old Republic, they realized they had to stop the Ubese from becoming a major threat. The sector ultimately decided a pre-emptive strike would sufficiently punish the Ubese and reduce their influence in the region.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Unfortunately, the orbital strike against the Ubese planets set off many of the species\' large-scale tactical weapons. Uba I, II, V were completely ravaged by radioactive firestorms, and Uba II was totally ruptured when its weapons stockpiles blew. Only on Uba IV, the Ubese homeworld, were survivors reported - pathetic, ravaged wretches who sucked in the oxygen-poor air in raspy breaths.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Sector authorities were so ashamed of their actions that they refused to offer aid - and wiped all references to the Uba system from official star charts. The system was placed under quarantine, preventing traffic through the region. The incident was so sufficiently hushed up that word of the devastation never reached Coruscant.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>The survivors on Uba scratched out a tenuous existence from the scorched ruins, poisoned soil and parched ocean beds. Over generations, the Ubese slowly evolved into survivors - savage nomads. They excelled at scavenging what they could from the wreckage.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Some Ubese survivors were relocated to a nearby system, Ubertica by renegades who felt the quarantine was a harsh reaction. They only managed to relocate a few dozen families from a handful of clans, however. The survivors on Uba - known today as the \"true Ubese\" - soon came to call the rescued Ubese yrak pootzck, a phrase which implies impure parentage and cowardly ways. While the true Ubese struggled for survival on their homeworld, the yrak pootzck Ubese on Ubertica slowly propagated and found their way into the galaxy.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>Millennia later, the true Ubese found a way off Uba IV by capitalizing on their natural talents - they became mercenaries, bounty hunters, slave drivers, and bodyguards.
